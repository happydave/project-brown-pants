# Sounding (project_brown_pants)

A KSP-inspired space-flight sandbox, built as an academic exercise in Rust + the
Bevy engine. This repository is the implementation; the architecture and design
live in the project's `tickets` repository under `docs/projects/sounding/`.

> Status: bootstrap (WI 496). A two-crate workspace skeleton — a headless
> simulation core and a windowed application — with dev-only remote tooling.

## Workspace layout

- [crates/sim/](crates/sim/) — `sounding_sim`, the **headless, rendering-free**
  simulation core. Depends on Bevy *sub-crates* (`bevy_app`, `bevy_ecs`), never
  the `bevy` umbrella, so it builds and runs with no display, GPU, or windowing
  libraries. The simulation logic lives here.
- [crates/app/](crates/app/) — `sounding`, the windowed Bevy application. Pulls in
  rendering (the `bevy` umbrella) and wraps the core.
- [content/](content/) — authored **content documents** (RON): `packs/` hold typed
  device / material / resource / body-reference records the sim looks up by id
  (WI 547; real physical quantities only); `overrides/` hold tuning documents —
  set / multiply / extend / delete field ops resolved through a deterministic
  named-phase merge ladder with per-value provenance (WI 548); `settings/` hold
  **named balance scalars** that can only *multiply* physically-defined values,
  frozen first and baked into the resolved catalog with the real value + named
  modifier kept in provenance (WI 549 — the physical-truth seam).
  `missions/` hold **mission documents** (WI 551) — offer / objective / effects,
  where objectives are condition trees over the bus telemetry snapshot and
  effects are envelope commands or lore beats;
  `scenarios/` hold **scenario documents** (WI 550) — each composes a playthrough by
  reference: a world (world-building's saved systems/bodies, or the built-in
  earthlike), enabled packs, settings docs, override sets, and a starting
  blueprint + placement + device-class → catalog-record bindings; `blueprints/`
  hold shipped starting craft (versioned persist documents).
  `packs/core.ron`, `overrides/example-scenario.ron`,
  `settings/example-settings.ron`, `scenarios/first-flight.ron`,
  `missions/first-hop.ron`, and `blueprints/first-flight.json` are the first
  of each.

## Prerequisites

- A modern Rust toolchain via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) (stable; developed on
  1.96). A distro `rustc` may be too old for Bevy 0.18.
- For the **windowed app** on Linux, Bevy's system libraries — at minimum
  `libwayland-dev` and `libxkbcommon-dev`; audio/gamepad support may also need
  `libasound2-dev` and `libudev-dev`. The headless core needs none of these.

## Build, run, test

- Build everything: `cargo build`
- Run the windowed app: `cargo run -p sounding`
- Run with dev tooling (Bevy Remote Protocol over HTTP): `cargo run -p sounding --features dev`
- Test the headless core (no display required): `cargo test -p sounding_sim`
- Quality gates: `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets`
- Dev-build performance: the dev profile optimizes dependencies and the sim crate (root `Cargo.toml`
  `[profile.dev...]`, WI 778) so a debug `cargo run` runs the engine + procedural surface at a playable
  frame rate. The **first** build after a clean/checkout is slower (deps compile optimized once), then
  cached; release builds are unaffected.

## Toy 5 — voxel ship editor

`cargo run -p sounding` opens the voxel editor: build a craft from voxels and
devices and watch its centre of mass, principal inertia axes, and aero
cross-sectional-area curve update live (all derived from the same voxels). A
craft saves and loads as a blueprint or a reusable subassembly through the
versioned serialization format. Editor controls:

- Arrow keys / `PageUp`·`PageDown` — move the build cursor (X/Z, then Y)
- `Space` add a voxel · `Backspace` remove voxel/device · `Tab` cycle material
- `G` place a device · `M` log mass properties
- `K` save vehicle · `O` load vehicle — a **named library** of many builds under
  `saves/crafts/` (WI 675): `K` opens a name prompt, `O` a load browser (↑/↓/Enter)
- `B` save blueprint · `N` save subassembly · `L` load subassembly · `V` insert it at the cursor

Camera: `Q`/`E` orbit · `R`/`F` pitch · `Z`/`C` zoom. The magenta marker is the
centre of mass, the RGB lines are the principal inertia axes, and the cyan plot
is the cross-section curve. Earlier toys keep running headless: the on-rails
orbit (Toy 1) and the runtime bus (Toys 2–3).

The app selects a toy scene at launch:

- `cargo run -p sounding` — the Toy 5 voxel editor (default)
- `cargo run -p sounding -- planet` — the Toy 4 floating-origin planet + atmosphere
- `cargo run -p sounding -- bodies` — the **body generator / keep loop** (WI 762): generate a celestial body from a seed + archetype (`Space` next seed, `Tab` Moon / Rocky Planet / Ocean World), shown as a coarse medium-tinted sphere with an atmosphere shell; `K` **keeps** it to `saves/bodies` (the reusable BodyAsset library). Middle-drag orbit, scroll zoom. Coarse render is a placeholder until the procedural surface (WI 763/764)
- `cargo run -p sounding -- surface [seed] [archetype]` — the **procedural surface renderer** (WI 764): fly a generated body from orbit down to its real cratered surface, tessellated live on a **spherified-cube quadtree LOD** over WI 763's analytic field (chunks meshed off-thread on the async compute pool, uploaded under a per-frame budget, **crack-free** via skirts). `W/A/S/D` move, `R/F` up/down, arrows look; `F3` toggles a debug overlay (per-LOD chunk wireframe + the nadir contact-patch marker for WI 765), `F4` a telemetry box (FPS graph + streaming stats). Per-body atmosphere is **data-driven** (airless bodies render without one). LOD transitions are hole-free (coverage-gated chunk despawn, WI 771). Render only — physics contact is `-- moon`
- `cargo run -p sounding -- moon` — **land and drive on a generated cratered moon** (WI 765, the world-building acceptance milestone): a rover drives on the **analytic** procedural surface field via the contact rebind (`W`/`S` throttle, `A`/`D` steer, `Space` brake, `P` pause), while the WI 764 streamer renders that same surface textured around it. Physics queries the field, never the mesh — so the rover can't fall through ungenerated ground and contact is stable under LOD/rebasing. Validated headless by a per-axis kraken test on the light editor-scale fixture
- `cargo run -p sounding -- scenario [path]` — **play a scenario from pure data** (WI 550, content Slice 1): loads a scenario document (default `content/scenarios/first-flight.ron`), composes its packs × settings × override sets into the resolved catalog, compiles its world by reference, loads its starting blueprint, and the **scenario director** spawns the craft onto the pad through the command envelope (`Command::SpawnScenario` — the same bus a player or MCP client uses) with engine/tank physics taken from the **catalog bindings**, balance scalars already baked (the shipped starter flies at 3200 × 0.85 × 0.9 = **2448 m/s** exhaust velocity — real value × named modifiers, shown with their rationales on the HUD and the bus `scenario` telemetry block). `Z` full throttle / `X` cut · `WSAD/QE` attitude · `T` SAS hold / `F` off · `P` pause · `.` step. Every reference is validated at load (missing packs/blueprints/systems/bindings/missions fail loudly by name). **WI 551:** the scenario's **missions** run live — the HUD lists each mission's state and latched progress (the shipped **First Hop** completes past 100 m and surfaces its lore beat), objective trees (`All`/`Any`/`Sequence` over altitude/speed/airborne leaves) evaluate against the same telemetry snapshot the bus serves, completion effects go through the command envelope, and `AfterMission` offers chain missions into a linear campaign
- `cargo run -p sounding -- rover` — the Toy 6 rover on terrain (`W`/`S` drive, `A`/`D` steer, `Space` brake, `P` pause, `.` step, `G` cockpit overlay; HUD shows speed/height; the overlay boxes live signal sparklines — contact_jitter/speed/ang.vel/hull_pen — WI 645/646). Built on the **same drivetrain as the workshop rover** (WI 641): off-road tyre/suspension wheel stations, quarter-car wheel hop, speed-eased steering — a fixed sandbox rover (no build UI) for exercising and inspecting the current rover physics
- `cargo run -p sounding -- dive` — the Toy 9 dive, the **full live chain in SI** (WI 527): one craft starts on a Kepler orbit, coasts down under time warp, **auto-drops** to active physics at the atmospheric entry interface, then **glides** (lift + transonic wave drag, weathervaning to trim — WI 526) vacuum→atmosphere→ocean to splashdown — drag/buoyancy/pressure all from one fluid field, and it enters at genuine **orbital speed** (~7 km/s, WI 693) and **heats on re-entry** (WI 691): a two-node thermal model glows it red→white-hot, and its **ablative heat-shield nose** (WI 688) ablates to survive — a draining `shield: NN %` on the HUD — while the composite hull survives (HUD shows gear, altitude/speed/medium, static hull pressure, dynamic ram pressure / max-Q, and **skin temperature** + an OVERHEAT flag)
- `cargo run -p sounding -- harbor` — **build-a-boat sandbox** (WI 706+): a **Build ↔ Float** loop (toggle `Enter`) that makes the buoyancy / compartment / flooding physics buildable. **Build** a hull on the shared editor — mouse place/remove, the left-edge **clickable palette** (WI 738), `Tab` material, **`T` panel mode** (thin, light plates for floating hulls, WI 716) — with a **live float/sink predictor** (WI 720). **Float** it on calm water at its **real material mass** (WI 717): a panel hull floats upright and **self-rights** (WI 705 righting buoyancy + WI 711 enclosed-air), a solid one **sinks** to the sea floor. A floated hull **sails and steers** (`W`/`S` throttle, `A`/`D` rudder — WI 708/725), **dives / surfaces** on ballast (`F` flood / `G` blow — WI 709), **breaches and floods** (`X` — WI 718/520), or **swamps** over the rim if open-topped (WI 713); interior water renders through one region-driven renderer (WI 729). Middle-drag orbit + wheel zoom; HUD shows draft / heel / net-buoyancy / thrust / ballast
- `cargo run -p sounding -- break` — structural breakage: a voxel bar spins up until the centripetal load snaps it into connected-component fragments that tumble apart
- `cargo run -p sounding -- compartments` — airtight compartments: a hollow craft's sealed volumes, colour-coded; `H` toggles a hatch (merge/split), `B` breaches the hull (vent)
- `cargo run -p sounding -- flooding` — decompression/flooding: a submerged craft; `B` breaches a compartment and it floods, tilts, and sinks as floodwater mass shifts the centre of mass
- `cargo run -p sounding -- windtunnel` — aero: live lift curve (Cl vs angle of attack) and wave-drag curve (Cd vs speed); `M` cycles the medium so the transonic spike appears in air and vanishes in water/vacuum
- `cargo run -p sounding -- launch` — surface lift-off (first-playable): a rocket rests on the pad, then auto-throttles up and ascends under thrust against gravity and drag (WI 531 propulsion + WI 532 launch-pad rest)
- `cargo run -p sounding -- autopilot` — a continuous one-craft session flown automatically (first-playable shell): Launch → Flight → Recovery (a sounding) on the unified flight pipeline; HUD shows phase, throttle, G-force, altitude/speed, and tilt, with an attitude gizmo (WI 534)
- `cargo run -p sounding -- play` — fly a craft by hand (WI 535): Shift/Ctrl throttle · Z/X full/cut · WSAD/QE attitude · T hold / R kill-rot / F SAS off / G re-capture-toggle · **1 prograde / 2 retrograde / 3 gravity-turn / 0 autopilot-off** (WI 565) · **`[`/`]` tune kp, `-`/`=` tune kd** (WI 566) · `,`/`.` warp; full flight HUD with Δv, apoapsis/periapsis, specific energy, the **control tier** (direct/stabilized/canned/tunable/uncontrolled — WI 562/565/566), SAS availability/re-capture (WI 564), the engaged autopilot, live SAS gains, and (WI 570) a **battery charge gauge** for a craft assembled from placed devices (control point + computer + battery) — on depletion the installed tier label is unchanged but an **ASSIST OFFLINE (low power)** marker appears and assistance drops to the unpowered floor. **C/V** (WI 571) downshift / restore the **player-selected control tier** (fly below capability for skill or to conserve power); the HUD shows **avail / sel / eff** tiers
- `cargo run -p sounding -- skins` — voxel-skin comparison (WI 582/583): the same craft rendered two ways and flown side by side from one sim state under the `hull_panel` PBR — **blocky** (per-cell cubes, Stormworks-style) vs the **greedy-meshed hull** (Starbase-style, the primary look), over a tiled **rocky-ground** surface (WI 588). WI 582 lands the blocky skin + the scene; WI 583 adds the hull
- `cargo run -p sounding -- land` — craft↔terrain collision demo (WI 590–592): a craft is dropped onto the tiled ground and the penalty contact response (detection via `parry3d-f64`) brings it to rest — `R` re-drop, `1`/`2` low/high drop
- `cargo run -p sounding -- collide` — craft↔craft collision demo (WI 593): fire a projectile craft (`SPACE`) at a target, plus a settling debris pile — the same penalty response generalized to body↔body — `R` reset
- `cargo run -p sounding -- crash` — breakage-on-impact demo (WI 594): hold `SPACE` to ram a frangible craft into a heavy block; a hard impact routes the contact force into fracture and it shatters into collidable fragments — `R` reset
- `cargo run -p sounding -- workshop` — grounded build-and-test sandbox (WI 599/602/603/604/607/611/612/613/614/618/630/631a/631b/634): **Build** a craft with the **mouse** on a solid 0.1 m grid (left-click a face to add, right-click to remove, middle-drag orbit, scroll zoom; pick blocks/devices/parts/wheels from the on-screen **palette** down the left edge — wheels come as **off-road / road / slick** rim+tyre presets (each drives differently) with an **optional suspension** strut (omit it and the wheel rides on the tyre's give) — or the keyboard: `Tab` material · `1`-`5` devices · `6`/`7` road wheel · `U` suspension · `8`/`9`/`0`/`-` seat/antenna/solar/bumper · **`K` save vehicle / `O` load vehicle** into a named library under `saves/crafts/` — `K` names it, `O` browses saved builds (WI 637/675); each material renders with its own surface) ↔ **Test** — *what you built*: a build with **wheels drives as a rover** (solid chassis + steering tyres + parts; W/S drive · A/D steer (smoothed + eased at speed) · Space brake; **change the tyres** and feel it — the HUD shows the wheel's grip/radius/slip, and each wheel now has its **own mass and suspension travel**, so it **hops and soaks up bumps** (you can watch the wheels work) instead of tracking the ground rigidly; **roll it** with a hard turn at speed or an obstacle clip, while normal driving stays upright; drive off the **30° ramp** to catch air and tumble; **ram an obstacle** and the facing **wheels shear off**, or **land a big drop too hard** and they tear off too (it then drives lopsided / rests on its **hull** — flip it over and it rests on its chassis, not bouncing on its wheels); hit it hard but short of shearing and a **part fails first** — a **tyre blows** (it runs on the rim, low grip, more drag), a **rim bends** (the corner pulls), or a **damper blows** (that corner goes bouncy), and the HUD/console names what broke; hit an obstacle **hard enough** and the **chassis itself fractures** (WI 629) into tumbling, collidable debris that settles on the pad — driving ends, **`Backspace` → BUILD** to rebuild; strong brakes lock at the grip limit; powered by an engine+tank → **fuel** or battery+solar → **charge**, shown in the HUD — run dry and it coasts; collides with **obstacles** on the pad), anything else **flies** on the textured ground with live collision (land, rest, crash → shatter); toggle with `Enter`, `Backspace` rebuilds, **`P` pauses/resumes** the world and **`.` steps** a paused world forward a beat (WI 638/643; also in `-- rover` and `-- play`; `.`/`Step` is also a bus/MCP command for inspection); **`G`** toggles a **cockpit overlay** of live signal sparklines (WI 645/646) and **`R`** enters a **replay cam** — scrub the last few seconds with `[`/`]` (WI 648; replay + screenshot are bus/MCP-drivable for AI inspection). **WI 624/652/653/654/655:** structural materials render with **bespoke per-material PBR textures** (brushed aluminium / steel / titanium / carbon, asset-harness); catalog **parts and devices render as their real mechanical-kit glb meshes**, seated on the clicked chassis face (Build **and** while driving); pick a **motor tier** with **`M`** (Economy / Standard / Performance / Heavy — sizes the drivetrain's torque, top-speed, mass, draw), shown in the HUD. **WI 617 (gamepad):** a connected **game controller** drives/flies/orbits alongside keyboard+mouse (additive) — left stick steer/roll + pitch, **triggers** throttle, **bumpers** yaw (air) / handbrake (ground), **right stick** camera (build orbit **and** free-look while driving/flying, WI 665), **Y** SAS, **Start** pause, **Back** → BUILD; rebindable mapping table with a deadzone (layout rationale in `docs/projects/sounding/design/controller-mapping-research.md`). **WI 775 (drive on a moon):** add `moon [seed]` — `cargo run -p sounding -- workshop moon` — to Test a built rover on a generated cratered **moonlet** instead of the flat pad. The wheels contact the **analytic** procedural surface (WI 765 rebind, streamed textured via WI 764) so it can't fall through and stays kraken-free; the HUD shows the moonlet's radius/gravity. The default `-- workshop` (flat pad) is unchanged
- `cargo run -p sounding -- gallery` — **part catalog viewer** (WI 653): every mechanical-kit part laid out on the ground grouped by category, slowly spinning; **middle-drag** orbit · **scroll** zoom · **WASD** pan · **Space** spin; **click a part** to inspect its read-only properties (name, category, material, orientation, verts, device mass)

## Runtime bus

While the app runs, a runtime state/command bus listens on
`http://127.0.0.1:8787` (a synchronous HTTP server on its own thread). It is the
shared substrate later consumers — the AI companion, second screen, multiplayer
sync — adapt onto. It is distinct from the dev-only Bevy Remote Protocol.

- `GET /telemetry` — current simulation snapshot as JSON (time, warp, paused,
  craft orbit and position, energy-drift metric; plus additive `active` / `rover` /
  `thermal` blocks when a scene publishes them — e.g. `thermal.max_skin_temp` in the dive).
- `POST /command` — inject a JSON command into the flight-control executor;
  malformed input returns HTTP 400.

```bash
curl -s localhost:8787/telemetry
curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/command -d '{"SetWarp":8.0}'
curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/command -d '{"SetPaused":true}'
curl -s -X POST localhost:8787/command \
  -d '{"ExecuteManeuver":{"delta_v":[0.0,0.1]}}'
```

A dev-only **MCP bridge** over this bus lives at [`dev/mcp/`](dev/mcp/README.md) (WI 639): a
stdlib-only stdio server exposing `get_telemetry` / `send_command` so an AI assistant can observe and
steer the running scene. It is registered by the user, never part of the game build.

## AI companion

`cargo run -p companion` starts an external agent that flies the craft through
the bus alone — it only reads `GET /telemetry` and issues `POST /command`,
reasoning purely from exposed telemetry (no privileged access). The shipped
deterministic navigator circularizes the orbit (coast to apoapsis, then a
prograde burn), narrating as it goes. The decision logic sits behind a `Brain`
trait, so an LLM-backed brain can replace it without changing the bus loop.

Run `cargo run -p sounding` first, then `cargo run -p companion` in a second
terminal. The app starts on a mildly eccentric orbit, so the navigator has a
visible circularization to perform; watch its narration in the companion's
terminal (the orbit runs headless behind the 3D scene).

## Notes

- **Headless invariant.** The core's freedom from rendering is verifiable:
  `cargo tree -p sounding_sim` shows no `bevy_render`, `bevy_winit`, or `wgpu`.
  Keep core-side crates on Bevy sub-crates so workspace feature unification does
  not drag rendering in.
- **Dev tooling is opt-in.** The Bevy Remote Protocol is compiled only under the
  `dev` feature, never in default or release builds.
